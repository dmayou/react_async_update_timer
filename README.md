# React Async Update Timer
Many applications need to poll an endpoint to refresh data after a certain interval.

I created a custom React Hook, useTimer, that calls an async callback function repeatedly. This hook can be imported into a React functional component.

The repeat interval is settable. Additionally, the hook returns the remaining time, which can be used to display 'time until refresh' for the data.
